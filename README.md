# Solidity Multi-Signature Wallet

## Getting Started

All the structure is ready for you in under `MultiSigWallet.sol`. Open the file, follow the comments and implement the missing details. 

Note that this is not how you should do a production ready multisig on Ethereum. You're gonna want to use something that's been audited and is secure. This is not a secure multisig.

## Testing

Run tests with `truffle test` while running `ganache-cli` in the background.
